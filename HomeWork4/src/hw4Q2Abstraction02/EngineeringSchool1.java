Q2:ii) (remaining) Now, answer how many keywords are used for the inheritance of Abstract Class? Can an Abstract Class inherit other Abstract Class or a regular class or interface? How many inheritances is possible by an Abstract Class? Use the all of above Abstract Classes (3) to answer my questions.

	 an abstract class can inherit only one abstract/regular class but not an interface; only one inheritance is possible by an abstract class

/*
1. why this class is twice?	
2. in previous class same constructor issue, should be before method
3. here, to extends you don't need to create same name, you created other abstract class, you can inherit them
