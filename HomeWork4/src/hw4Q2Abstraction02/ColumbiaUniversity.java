 Q.2-iii) Create a regular Class ColumbiaUniversity, create 2 methods inside the class - one is abstract and another one is the non-abstract name -- chemistry and biology. if not possible to create, simply comment out the method and explain why in comment out. Print something inside the non-abstract or implemented method. Can you create a Constructor inside a regular Class? If yes, create default Constructor. If no, comment out the created constructor and answer why not?
